Using TikTok for Your Business
You might wonder whether your business would benefit from starting a TikTok account, but with a little preparation and thought, you can absolutely add that to your business toolbelt. Here are some basic starting points and food for thought as you go about becoming a creator for your business.

Where to Begin and What to Think About
In “Who Uses TikTok” we learned about Dave Jorgenson, video producer for the Washington Post. When creating the newspaper’s TikTok, Jorgenson created a research packet for himself and the other editors, and although you don’t need quite that level of knowledge, a little prep work can go a long way. Some things to consider might be: 

Get to know the app: What are the various features for creating videos and how might you use them? What sorts of trends and hashtags are currently popular? How often do you want to post and what kind of story do you want to tell about your business? 

Create a personality for your business. For example, Jorgenson uses his dad jokes and self-deprecating humor while being relatable and engaging with the audience. 

Brainstorm ideas for new content often, but also pay attention to the trends and hashtags that are currently popular to stay current. Let these guide you in what you post.

See what other businesses you admire and that have a good following are doing. Even if it’s not directly within the field of your own business, you might gain valuable insight into how you can use TikTok for your own business. 

Using Hashtags and Trends
Once you have created your business’ style and approach, start exploring hashtags, challenges, and other trends. It can be as simple as creating your own version of a trending song or an original skit to as involved as starting your own branded hashtag, which is a paid opportunity to partner with TIkTok to create a special hashtag for your business. 

No matter how you choose to use hashtags and trends, the benefits of doing so can be numerous. You can create brand awareness, inviting new followers and thereby potential customers. You can renew your brand’s image, such as bringing in a younger audience. You can also create and maintain your business’ community and cultivate loyalty to your brand. 

What Else Does TikTok Offer My Business? 
Creating new, relevant content will be an essential part of using TikTok successfully for your business, but it’s not the only upside to the app. TikTok also offers various advertising opportunities, both in terms of having other creators create their own content to advertise your products– (e.g., partnering with influencers), and also for you to create your own ads yourself. You can also create branded hashtags and start your own trends to promote your business by going viral. 

TikTok recently set up a partnership with Shopify and other ecommerce merchants, meaning that you can also add an ecommerce integration to your business’ account so that it’s even easier for customers to give you their business. Using TikTok's Ads Manager, you can see how your campaigns and content are performing and tweak your marketing strategies accordingly.

TikTok also offers specific resources to help you incorporate TikTok into your marketing strategies. Let’s explore a few.

TikTok for Business
TikTok for Business
 offers step-by-step guides on how to create successful ads on the platform–in other words making videos rather than ads. TikTok for Business includes an ad manager for any size business and even a blog about using the app for your business. Whether you’re just starting out your campaign, or have a few under your belt, TikTok will lead you through the process. 

Creator Marketplace
One great way to grow your audience and gain credibility is to partner with an influencer, which is a fellow creator with a large audience and a similar niche or brand as what you’re hoping to build for your own business. The 
Creator Marketplace
 is a hub where you can search for creators, invite them to collaborate with you, and view insights about their account. 

Creative Center
According to the 
Creative Center
 site, allows you to “discover what's popular on TikTok right now, learn how to create TikToks like a pro, and find out what's making other brands successful on our platform.” For example, if you need inspiration, you can look at top ads to see what’s most successful. You can also explore various tools such as popular audio clips and music, TikTok video editor and ad templates and even optimization. 

#ForYou Summit
In 2021, TikTok held its first 
#ForYou Summit
, an “event designed to inspire marketers and usher in a new era of culture and commerce on TikTok.” The event included speakers talking about topics such as entertainment, product innovation, and storytelling on TikTok. Geared toward brand marketers of all levels, this is a great opportunity to explore the app with experts and even connect with other marketers.
